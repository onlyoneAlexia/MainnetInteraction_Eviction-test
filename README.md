# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
Write a contract that uses a pseudorandom generator to play ludo. Basically, implement a simple version of the ludo map and also focus mainly on the dice throwing algorithm. There is no strict design to this. You can use any design method you want.
